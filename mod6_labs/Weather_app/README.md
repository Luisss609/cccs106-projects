## Project Overview
[The Weather App is a Python program developed with Flet and enables the user to access real time weather data by typing in a city name. It pulls live weather data of an online weather API and presents important information about the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather condition icon. The application has a clean and easy to use interface, a light and dark theme switch, and it presents animated results to have a more visual experience. It also retains the recent searching history to enable one to access the previously searched places easily. All in all, the Weather App is a handy and easy method to review proper weather forecasts at any time.]
